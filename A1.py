"""
1. Unsmoothed n-grams
    - compute unigram & bigram probabilities from the training corpus
    - can only use libraries for preprocessing (corpus already tokenized tho)
"""

"""
2. Smoothing & unknown words
    - 1) implement a method (or multiple methods) to handle unknown words
    - 2) implement the two smoothing methods (ex. Laplace & Add-k smoothing w/ different k)
"""

"""
3. Perplexity on Validation Set
    - compute the perplexity of the development/validation set --> val.txt
    - equation given in pdf
    - if we use more than one type of smoothing and unknown word handling, compare perplexity results in report
